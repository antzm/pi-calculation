# pi-calculation

A small script to calculate the PI number = 3,14159

Pi (Greek π) calculation is based on the calculation
of a sum of an infinite series.

There are infinite series which converge fast and thus,
they provide a good approximation of Pi after adding
a small number of terms.

There are also other infinite series where we need to
calculate a great number of terms and find their sum
in order to provide a Pi aproximation with only 
a few correct decimal digits.

In this case, the following infinite series will be used:

π^2    1     1     1     1     1
--- = --- + --- + --- + --- + --- + ...
 6    1^2   2^2   3^2   4^2   5^2
