# pi-calculation

A small script to calculate the PI number = 3,14159

Pi (Greek Ï€) calculation is based on the calculation
of a sum of an infinite series.

There are infinite series which converge fast and thus,
they provide a good approximation of Pi after adding
a small number of thers.

There are also other infinite series which need to
calculate a great number of terms and find their sum
in order to provide a small aproximation of Pi.
